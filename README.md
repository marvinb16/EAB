EAB
Version 0.1 - Alpha Build

EAB is a all in one program requiring a few addons which aid and help in cultivating and growing plants/herbs/vegitables. The goal is a gui with temperature readings, growing times, humidiy, temperature control, lighting, and automated cycles. These can be adjusted any time and fully customizable. I will be using a Raspberry Pie with a custom made GUI Program.

Coding Languages:
 * Python

Modules Used:

Main Computer/Server:
Raspberry Pie v3


Sensors:
+ 2 x DHT 22 - Temp and humidity
+ Webcam - Live Feed.
