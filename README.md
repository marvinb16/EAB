Emma's Assissted Botonist
Version 0.1 - Alpha Build

Emma's Assissted Botonist is a all in one program requiring a few addons which aid and help in cultivating and growing plants/herbs/vegitables. I will be adding a gui with temperature readings, growing times, humidiy, temperature control, lighting, and automated cycles. These can be adjusted any time and fully customizable. This is my first major programming project so bear with the bugs. I will be using a Raspberry Pie with the Home Assisstant software, including its own standalone gui made with python for a dedicated monitor for easy accessibility.
